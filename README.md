# What is FitVenture (Purpose and Benefits)?

> FitVenture is a free-to-use application which was made to change the way people look at fitness. Through interactive features like weight and run goals, daily challenges, and the main feature achievements.

> Achievements visualise the comparison between the covered distance or calories with the length of either real world objects or daily calorie consumption of animals. FitVenture encourages people to be more active and improves their user experience. 

> FitVenture customers can create their own running and weight goals and keep track of their progress via the Bar Charts and Progress Bars. Additionally, user has opportunity to participate in daily challenges to get better motivation to exercise.

### Software architecture
- User register, fills in personal information, which system saves into the JSON file 
- User login and goes to the main dashboard, where they can see their progress and statistics via the Bar Chart  
- On the main dashboard screen screen user can see the temperature & humidity values from the [sensor](https://wiki.seeedstudio.com/Grove-TemperatureAndHumidity_Sensor/) 
- Goals, daily challenges and achievements pages are accessible from the main dashboard 

### Hardware architecture

- [Arduino Wio Terminal](https://wiki.seeedstudio.com/Wio-Terminal-Getting-Started/) is connected to [three components](https://git.chalmers.se/courses/dit113/2024/group-7/fitventure/-/wikis/Components) via the 4-pin cabels 
- Temperature & humidity are visible on the [Arduino Wio Terminal](https://wiki.seeedstudio.com/Wio-Terminal-Getting-Started/) screen 
- XYZ Data from the [Accelerometer Sensor](https://wiki.seeedstudio.com/Grove-3-Axis_Digital_Accelerometer-1.5g/) is converted to the distance, which is used to calculate steps and calories burned
- [Button component](https://wiki.seeedstudio.com/Grove-Button/) is used to start/finish the exercise session
- The wio-terminal and PC are connected through the publish-subscribe pattern via the MQTT Broker 

# Main contribution 
_PS: Every group member wrote his personal opinion about the main contribution_

#### Danylo Baranov: 
> The PM for the period of the whole project, worked with git workflow organisation. Implemented login and registration page, JSON and project structure organisation, time chart for goals, start/end timer for the race (WIO, Back-end, MQTT), Folder structure fix (.gitignore, maven dependencies), worked with the bug fix of the publishing to the MQTT. Helped teammates with bug fixes throughout the project. 

#### Oleksandr Kozlov:
>  The initial UI and the logic behind User Profile, Goals Page and the complete redesign of the whole application UI towards the end of the project. Also, worked partially with the MQTT publish/subscribe of the userâ€™s info and the sensor data.

#### Danis Music:
> Worked on the additional optional information in the registration page, the continuous integration pipelines for both the java application aswell as the arduino.  Worked on the achievements feature aswell. Fixed sourceDirectory issue aswell as created the content to .gitignore file

#### Abdullahi Mahamed:
> 

#### Jackson Niyomugabo:
> Ardunino's connection notification to the user, Progress visualization of data (Creation of Bar chart for day, week and month). Setting of weight goals and saving of the goals to the json file. Goals completion notification for both weight goal and running goals 

#### Stefan Tram:
> Mainly developed the data saving structure/logic and improved the way data is shown on charts. Contributed to main issues such as CI and Achievements.
